## Challenges Faced
### CORS Issue with PDF.js
When attempting to load a PDF using `pdfjs-dist`, a CORS error occurred due to the following line:
```js
pdfjs.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = `https://unpkg.com/pdfjs-dist@${pdfjs.version}/build/pdf.worker.min.js`;
```
**Cause:** The external worker file could not be fetched due to CORS restrictions.

**Possible Solutions:**
1. Serve the worker file locally instead of using an external URL.
2. Use a different PDF rendering approach.
3. Modify server headers to allow cross-origin requests.

Due to time constraints, this issue was not fully resolved but is noted for future improvement.

## Future Improvements
- Resolve the PDF.js CORS issue
- Optimize performance for large PDFs
- Implement better error handling and UI feedback
